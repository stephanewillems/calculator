Gotchas: watch out for and fix these bugs if they show up in your code:

## ** ALMOSt DONE**
Users should be able to string together several operations and get the right answer: 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 etc. The behavior we’re looking for should be something like this https://www.online-calculator.com/.

display.value is not working when going into loop with count ++ for extra operations.

# **TODO**
You should round answers with long decimals so that they don’t overflow the screen.
## **DONE**
Pressing = before entering all of the numbers or an operator could cause problems!
## **DONE**
Pressing “clear” should wipe out any existing data.. make sure the user is really starting fresh after pressing “clear”
## **DONE**
Display a snarky error message if the user tries to divide by 0… don’t let it crash your calculator!

## **DONE**
EXTRA CREDIT: Users can get floating point numbers if they do the math required to get one, but they can’t type them in yet. Add a . button and let users input decimals! Make sure you don’t let them type more than one though: 12.3.56.5. It is hard to do math on these numbers. (disable the decimal button if there’s already one in the display)
## **DONE**
EXTRA CREDIT: Make it look nice! This can be a good portfolio project… but not if it’s UGLY. At least make the operations a different color from the keypad buttons.
## **DONE**
EXTRA CREDIT: Add a “backspace” button, so the user can undo if they click the wrong number.

# **DONE**
When clicking -/+ this needs to be in front of the array

ARRAY.unshift() to add number to beginning of array

# **TODO**
EXTRA CREDIT: Add keyboard support!
